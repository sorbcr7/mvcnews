               <b> More and more traditional media companies are now offering this cluster of services, often calling it a “digital agency” approach. I wrote about this here and here – about how we went after it at Morris, although our model has changed a lot since then.</b>
               <pre>
<b>1.Content marketing.</b> A huge opportunity, covered here. In a direct-access world, a business can present its own case directly to consumers, using all kinds of media. But to do that, it needs to develop high-quality content and figure out how to get it in front of its most likely potential customers. It needs help with both of these tasks.

2.E-commerce. Amazon and the big-box stores are selling huge amounts of inventory online, leaving local retailers in the dust. As I described here, we’re in a great position to help them get into the game.

3.Business systems. A new wave of in-store point-of-sale systems is coming – systems that will capture customer data and make it usable for post-sale marketing. As I wrote here, we could be the ones to offer them – and to supply the marketing expertise needed to capitalise on the data.

4.Data services. Everybody talks about Big Data, but who helps local businesses figure out how to use it to increase their sales? We could be the ones, as I wrote here.

5.Beacon solutions. I haven’t written about this new solution yet, as it still seems early in the development of powerful ways to use them for customer behaviour tracking and customer communications. But as those become clearer, beacon services would be a natural fit among the solutions offered by a local marketing agency.

6.Promotions and events. As I wrote here, in-store traffic is declining fast, and we could be the ones to help local businesses figure out how to buck the trend with custom promotions and events in their stores.

7.Recruitment services. Job listings are only the most basic need of an employer who’s trying to fill jobs. As I wrote here, employers want and need more sophisticated help, and a local marketing agency could provide it.</pre>
